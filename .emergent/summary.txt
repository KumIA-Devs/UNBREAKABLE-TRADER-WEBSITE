The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive, responsive, and bilingual landing page for Unbreakable Trader. The development process involved numerous iterations, focusing on design aesthetics, emotional copy, dynamic content, and deployment. Key challenges included adapting to specific UI/UX guidelines, resolving persistent dependency conflicts in the frontend (especially with , , and ), and troubleshooting deployment issues across Squarespace and Vercel. The AI demonstrated persistence in debugging build failures and guided the user through complex DNS configurations. The product now boasts a clean, functional frontend, but the immediate hurdle is ensuring the correct build artifacts are deployed to Vercel, as a placeholder page is currently displayed.

<pending_tasks>
- **Redeploying the frontend to Vercel with the correct build artifacts.** The user encountered an En construcción page, implying that the previously built  folder was not correctly uploaded or served.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was troubleshooting a deployment issue on Vercel. The application build process had been successfully resolved after multiple dependency and configuration cleanups, resulting in a clean, functional React frontend. DNS settings for  were successfully updated to point to Vercel's nameservers. However, the user reported that the site preview on Vercel was showing an En construcción (Under Construction) page instead of the actual Unbreakable Trader landing page. This indicates that despite the successful build and DNS configuration, the *correct* compiled frontend files were not successfully deployed or are not being served by Vercel. The last message from the AI engineer was diagnosing this as WRONG FILES deployed and proposing to REDEPLOYAR CON ARCHIVOS CORRECTOS.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Redeploy the correct  folder of the frontend application to Vercel to ensure the Unbreakable Trader landing page is displayed.
